# Udacity Full Stack Development Nanodegree

This is the **capstone project** of Udacity's Full Stack Development Nanodegree

---

## Data Modeling

### Architect Relational Database Models in Python

Key data models are defined using SQLAlchemy in [here](workspace/backend/application/models.py)

Below is the ERD generated by [ERAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/ERAlchemy/)

<img src="doc/data-modeling--erd.png" alt="Entity Relationship Diagram"/>

### Utilize SQLAlchemy to Conduct Database Queries

* Does not use raw SQL or only where there are not SQLAlchemy equivalent expressions
* Correctly formats SQLAlchemy to define models
* Creates methods to serialize model data and helper methods to simplify API behavior such as insert, update and delete.

---

## API Architecture and Testing

### Follow RESTful Principles of API Development

In this project all the RESTful endpoints are implemented using [Flask RESTplus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) inside [here](workspace/backend/application/api/v2)

### Structure Endpoints to Respond to Four HTTP methods with Error Handling

The interactive RESTful endpoints using [Swagger UI](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/swagger.html#swaggerui) can be accessed at [here](TBD)

Here is the overview of **posts** endpoints

<img src="doc/restful-api--posts.png" alt="RESTful API Posts"/>

#### Utilize the @app.errorhandler Decorator to Format error Responses as JSON Ojects for at least Four Different Status Codes

All error handlers are implemented inside [here](workspace/backend/application/api/v2/errors.py)

### Enable Role Based Authentication and Roles-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Flask application

#### Project Implements a Custom @requires_auth Decorator

The custom @requires_auth decorator, which implementes
    * Authentication
    * Authorization
can be found [here](workspace/backend/application/api/v2/auth/decorators.py)

#### Project Includes at least Two Different Roles that Have Distinct Permissions for Actions

The two roles defined in this project are as follows:

First role is **admin**, which can perform all actions on posts.

Second role is **user**, which can perform all actions except delete on posts.

<img src="doc/rbac--roles-user.png.png" alt="Roles User"/>

### Demonstrate Validity of API Behavior

* Includes at least one test for expected success and error behavior for each endpoint using the unittest library
* Includes tests demonstrating role-based access control, at least two per role.

## Third-Party Authentication

### Configure Third-Party Authentication Systems

Auth0 is set up and running at the time of submission. All required configuration settings are included in a bash file which export:

- The Auth0 Domain Name
- The JWT code signing secret
- The Auth0 Client ID

### Configure Roles-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Roles and Permission Tables are Configured in Auth0

The two roles defined in this project are as follows:

First role is **admin**, which can perform all actions on posts.

<img src="doc/rbac--roles-admin.png" alt="Roles Administrator"/>

Second role is **user**, which can perform all actions except delete on posts.

<img src="doc/rbac--roles-user.png" alt="Roles User"/>

#### Access of Roles is Limited. Includes at least Two Different Roles with Different Permissions

Below is the association between roles and accounts in this project

<img src="doc/rbac--role-association-admin.png" alt="Role Association Administrator"/>

<img src="doc/rbac--role-association-user.png" alt="Role Association User"/>

#### The JWT Includes the RBAC Permission Claims

The generated JWT can be analyzed in the [JWT Online Debugger](https://jwt.io/)

Here is one example of decoded JWT payload, which contains the permissions field.

<img src="doc/rbac--jwt-payload.png" alt="Permissions in JWT Payload"/>

## Deployment

### Application is Hosted Live at Student Provided URL

* API is hosted live via Heroku
* URL is provided in project README
* API can be accessed by URL and requires authentication

### Includes Instructions to Set Up Authentication

First, get the required JWT for Authorization header at [here](TBD)

After that, all the APIs can be tested interactively inside [Swagger UI](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/swagger.html#swaggerui). Please interact with the APIs [here](TBD)

## Code Quality & Documentation

### Write Clear, Concise and Well Documented Code

All the core functionalities follows recommended coding practices plus ample comment for understanding.

### Project Demonstrates Reliability and Testability

The backend is deployed for production using the following best practices:

* One
* Two
* Three

### Project Demonstrates Maintainability

The project has been structured according to [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xv-a-better-application-structure)'s recommended best practices.

### Project Includes Thorough Documentation

The project has been well documented both for local and on Heroku evaluation.
